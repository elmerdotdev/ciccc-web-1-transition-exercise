# Web 1 - Transition and Animation Exercise

**Instructions:** Create an `index.html` and `styles.scss` and create the transitions/animations listed in the **Tasks**. Once you are done, commit and push your changes.

## Tasks

1. Create a new circle with a yellow background color and make it disappear when the user hovers over it.

2. Using the same circle, create an animation that moves the circle to the edges of the screen and changes its shape between a circle and a square:

   top left (circle) => top right (square) => bottom right (circle) => bottom left (square) => top left (circle)

4. Create a loading bar that fills up from left to right.
